STEP 1: Create a New API
    Title: OpenAPI Specification for CMS
    Description: API Specification document of the CMS System
    Contact: Priyam Vyas
    Version: 1.0

STEP 2: Identify the Type of API
    Public

STEP 3: Identify the Server Base URL
    http://{{baseUrl}}

STEP 4: Identify the Resource
    Resource: Students

STEP 5: Define Student Attributes
    - studentId (integer, unique)
    - firstName (string)
    - lastName (string)
    - phoneNumber (string)
    - address (string)

STEP 6: List Operations on Students
    1. GET /students → Get all students
    2. GET /students/{studentId} → Get a specific student
    3. POST /students → Add a new student
    4. PUT /students/{studentId} → Update an existing student
    5. DELETE /students/{studentId} → Delete a student entry
    6. GET /courses/{courseId}/students → Get students belonging to a course
    7. POST /courses/{courseId}/students → Add a student to a course

STEP 7: Define Request/Response Examples
    Example GET (all students):
        Response: 
        [
          {
            "studentId": 101,
            "firstName": "James",
            "lastName": "Smith",
            "phoneNumber": "555-555-1234",
            "address": "US"
          }
        ]

    Example POST (add student):
        Request:
        {
          "firstName": "Maria",
          "lastName": "Rodriguez",
          "phoneNumber": "555-555-3333",
          "address": "US"
        }
        Response:
        {
          "studentId": 103,
          "firstName": "Maria",
          "lastName": "Rodriguez",
          "phoneNumber": "555-555-3333",
          "address": "US"
        }

STEP 8: Define Error Handling
    - 400 Bad Request → Invalid input (e.g., wrong phone format)
    - 404 Not Found → Student or Course not found
    - 500 Internal Server Error → System error

STEP 9: Define Authentication
    - Basic Auth for some endpoints
    - Bearer Token for delete operations

STEP 10: Define Response Codes
    - 200 OK → Successful retrieval/update/delete
    - 201 Created → Successful creation
    - 204 No Content → Successful deletion
    - 400/404/500 → Errors

STEP 11: Define Versioning (if required)
    - URL versioning: /v1/students
    - Query parameter: /students?version=1
    - Header versioning: X-API-Version: 1

STEP 12: Finalize the API Specification
    - Document all endpoints clearly
    - Provide request/response schemas
    - Include authentication details
    - Add error response samples
