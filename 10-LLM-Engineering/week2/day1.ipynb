       "\n",
       "### Step 1: Understand the structure of each volume\n",
       "\n",
       "Each volume has:\n",
       "\n",
       "- A front cover: 2 mm = 0.2 cm\n",
       "- Pages: 2 cm (total for all pages)\n",

       "= 0.2 cm + 2 cm + 0.2 cm = **2.4 cm**\n",

       "### Step 3: How the volumes are positioned\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Volume 1**: covers from the front cover to the back cover\n",

       "- Then, through the **gap** between the volumes (say, negligible for simplicity or possibly a small gap)\n",
       "- Inside **volume 2**, from the back cover to the last page: 0.2 cm (cover thickness)\n",
       "\n",
       "However, if the volumes are tightly packed, the **main distance** is:\n",
       "\n",
       "- From the first page of volume 1, going inward to the back cover: 2 cm\n",
       "- Then across the gap between the volumes (unknown? possibly minimal)\n",
       "- Then into the volume 2, from the cover inward to the last page: 2 cm\n",
       "\n",
       "Alternatively, assume the volumes are directly side by side: the gnawing path is:\n",
       "\n",
       "- From the first page of volume 1 (near its front cover),\n",
       "- Then, through the **interface** between the two books (which could be considered as negligible or counted as zero),\n",
