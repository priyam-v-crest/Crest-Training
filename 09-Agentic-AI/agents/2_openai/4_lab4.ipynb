       "**Agent Lightning** is a flexible framework that enables reinforcement learning-based training of large language models (LLMs) for any AI agent. It decouples agent execution from training, allowing seamless integration with existing agents developed through various methods. By formulating agent execution as a Markov decision process, it introduces a hierarchical RL algorithm, LightningRL, facilitating complex interaction logic handling. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03680?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "**Polymorphic Combinatorial Framework (PCF)** leverages LLMs and mathematical frameworks to guide the design of adaptive AI agents. It enables real-time parameter reconfiguration through combinatorial spaces, allowing agents to dynamically adapt their behavioral traits. Grounded in combinatorial logic and fuzzy set theory, PCF defines a multidimensional parameter space (SPARK) to capture agent behaviors, supporting scalable and ethical AI applications. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01581?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "**GoalfyMax** introduces a protocol-driven framework for end-to-end multi-agent collaboration. It features a standardized Agent-to-Agent communication layer based on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing independent agents to coordinate through asynchronous, protocol-compliant interactions. The Experience Pack (XP) architecture preserves task rationales and execution traces, enabling structured knowledge retention and continual learning. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09497?utm_source=openai))\n",

       "**Cognitive Kernel-Pro** is an open-source, multi-module agent framework designed to democratize the development and evaluation of advanced AI agents. It systematically investigates the curation of high-quality training data for Agent Foundation Models, focusing on the construction of queries, trajectories, and verifiable answers across key domains. The framework also explores novel strategies for agent test-time reflection and voting to enhance robustness and performance. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00414?utm_source=openai))\n",
